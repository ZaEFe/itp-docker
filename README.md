# Docker Static App Deployment


This is a local deployment to run server-side PHP scripts integrated with an NGINX webserver.


## Architecture

- An NGINX container serves HTTP traffic on port 8080 and uses a PHP-FPM container to run the PHP scripts.
- php uses the MySQL db to handle database access by calling `db-svc` on the port specified in the `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

- Docker version (27.4.0, build bde2b89)+
- sh shell with typical tools

## Testing Notes

- Tested on Windows 11 Home
- Tested with Docker version 27.4.0, build bde2b89
- Tested with Git Bash

## Usage
1. Rename [db.env.template](db.env.template) to be called `db.env` and customize the username, password, and port

2. Initialize the file structure and volumes.
    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/init.sh;
    ./scripts/init.sh;
    ```
    **Note**: be sure to rerun this if you want to delete the data for the db so that it will initialize on upping the stack.
3. To up the compose stack:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d;
    ```
4. Visit the homepage by going to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in the browser.

5. Click the link you find on the homepage. You should see the PHP info with some purple coloring.

6. To down the compose stack:
    ```bash
    docker compose down;
    ```
